# Ant-Social-Network-With-Null-Models_--Network-Motifs
Social network analysis has become an indispensable tool in analyzing biomedical complex networks, such protein-protein interactions, and ecological networks. Among the most studied animal networks; The Ant Colony Social Network,  which has inspired developers to create efficient algorithms like Ant Colony optimization.  In our study, weâ€™re analyzing ants social network in order to test hypothesis about the nature of this network, by comparing this network to randomly  generated network using the Erdos-Renyi model.
